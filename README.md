## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

When applying the formula to get the relationship between one coefficient (mpg) or variable versus the others, R displays the follow values:

Coefficients:

     (Intercept)    vehicle_length    vehicle_weight     spoiler_angle  ground_clearance  
     
      -1.040e+02         6.267e+00         1.245e-03         6.877e-02         3.546e+00  
             
             AWD  
      -3.411e+00  

We are comparing the mpg coefficients with the others, then we can see there is a slightly correlation between them, analyzing first vehicle_length and spoiler_angle, we can say there is a moderate correlation cause their values are nearly 7, and for values over 7 the sthenght of correlation is consider strong, however the coefficient groud_clearance is slighly over 3, so it is consider a weak correlation, for vehicle_weigth the correlation can be consider none, and for AWG coefficient altought it is a negative value the correlation is weak but it has more than 3 to be consider. Respecting the Intercept value we can see that it is negative, showing that the slope is decrecient, it means that when the x values increase, the y values decrease, for these analysis it could sound right, becasue the mpg values determine how fast a vehicle can be, in less time, while getting a mile of distance, so if the others coefficients like weigth, length, spoiler, ground clearance and AWG increase, In my opinion, they are determinant variables to make a car faster or less fats. Then if one these variables increase, it can be a fact that the mpg is going to decrease.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

It could be zero in the case the coefficients increse dramatically, but for these example I think it wont get the zero value.

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

I think the prediction has a consider difference while comparing differents coefficients, the calculation below, shows how values vary if we take first mpg coefficients versus the others coefficients and then we compare vehicle_lenght versus the others, differences are consider, besides in the  images below, there are two examples, comparing mpg vs vehicle_lenght and mpg vs spoiler_angle the graphs show a weak or moderate strength of correlation.
